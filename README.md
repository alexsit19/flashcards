In everyday life people need to learn different subjects with new terms or learn words in a new

can help them to store all flashcards in a mobile app.

In development i used android jetpack components:
* Navigation component
* Room for work with SQLite database
* Lifecycle aware components
* Recycler view and ViewPager 2
